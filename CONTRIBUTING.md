## Docs Website

The website's content aims to be clean and technical. It aids the community with their PON-related needs and
helps potential sponsors understand what we are all about!

To contribute to existing guides and/or create new ones, the markdown files can be found within the
[posts directory](./docs/guides/posts).

Full page screenshots aid users with navigation and are the desired. To take a screenshot follow the guides for
your browser of choice:

* FireFox:
  https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/take-screenshots-firefox
* Edge:
  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/learning-center/screenshot-webpage
* Chrome:

* Safari:

Furthermore to save bandwidth and increase load times, screenshots should be converted to the webp format with
[cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp) using 60% resolution e.g.
`cwebp -q 60 screenshot.jpg/png -o screenshot.webp`.

The artwork is created in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and mixed with assets from
[@storyset](https://www.freepik.com/author/stories) on Freepik. When finished, the artwork is exported at a 1280x960p
resolution and converted to webp with the same utility and options as the screenshots.

## Issues

Issues can be reported here on github or our [community discord server](https://discord.pon.wiki). Pull requests are
