# History

In October 2018, a group of curious Canadian software developers established what would eventually become 8311 on the
now-defunct [DSLReports]  [Bell Canada] sub-forum.

Due to DSLR policies regarding reverse engineering and [hackers], a [Slack] workspace named *"BELLY-UP"* was created with
the focus of discussion and development revolved around the cat-and-mouse game of rooting the Home Hub 3000 and
Home Hub 4000, CPE provided by [Bell Canada] and manufactured by [Sagemcom], as well as development and support for
2.5Gbps network hardware built around the [Broadcom] WarpCore and [Marvell] ARMADA to support the use of SFP+ GPON
ONT, inclusive to the [Huawei]  [MA5671A], [Alcatel-Lucent]  [G-010S-P] and [Nokia] G-010S-A of [Bell Labs].

As interest in the [Broadcom] WarpCore patches grew, the limitations of Slack's free tier became apparent.
Therefore, in September 2021, *"BELLY-UP"* moved to [Discord] as the [8311 community server] to serve a broader
worldwide audience.
