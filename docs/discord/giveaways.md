# Giveaways

Giveaways are occasionally organized through the generosity of our community and its members.

To participate in a giveaway, you must first be an active member and unlock the *Bazaar* in the __#Channels & Roles__
channel.

Once unlocked, you will gain access to the __#giveaways__ channel, where you can enter *any* active giveaways
if you qualify for entry.

If you'd like to host a giveaway, please contact an admin or email: sponsor at pon.wiki to arrange the details.
