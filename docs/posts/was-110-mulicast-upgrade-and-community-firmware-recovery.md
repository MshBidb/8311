!!! tip "Forgot the *root* password to a [WAS-110] running the 8311 community firmware? Follow along with the [reset](#reset) steps..."
    If you lack the required networking skills to proceed with this guide, please consider purchasing a
    [SFP Media Buddy](https://whinis.com/sfp-buddy/) and deleting the `8311_root_pwhash` environment variable over
    serial USB within the [U-Boot] shell.

    1. Press ++escape++ on boot to enter the [U-Boot] shell

    2. Delete the `8311_root_pwhash` environment variable

           ```sh
           env delete 8311_root_pwhash
           env save
           env save
           ```

    3. Continue to boot into OpenWrt

           ```sh
           run bootcmd
           ```

The [WAS-110] from the Azores factory includes a handy multicast upgrade utility baked into its U-boot bootloader,
including models from the following resellers:

* Azores Networks XSS
* E.C.I. Networks EN-XGSFPP-OMAC-V2 <small>*Incompatible with the EN-XGSFPP-OMAC*</small>
* FiberMall XGSPON-ONU-STICK <small>*Incompatible with the XGSPON-ONU-STICK-V8*</small>

## Upgrade Sequence

The upgrade sequence is tied into the boot delay loop and therefore will not trigger if the [U-Boot] environment variable
`bootdelay` is less than or equal to zero (0); The default value is three (3).

=== "OpenWrt"

    ``` sh
    fw_printenv bootdelay
    ```

=== "U-Boot"

    ``` sh
    env print bootdelay
    ```

The upgrade sequence will wait 5 seconds for the first magic UDP packet on port `13456`. Each packet must include the
following header:

<!--
``` mermaid
packet-beta
title Multicast Upgrade Packet Header (st_upg_hdr)
0-31: "Sequence Number (ui_sn: 4 bytes, starts at 1)"
32-63: "Block Size (blk_sz: 4 bytes)"
64-95: "Unknown (4 bytes, must not be 0)"
96-127: "Image Size (img_sz: 4 bytes)"
128-287: "bfw-HGW\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0 (20 byte string)"
```
-->

``` mermaid
block-beta
  block
    columns 1
    ui_sn["Sequence number (4 bytes, starts at 1)"]
    blk_sz["Block size (4 bytes)"]
    unk["Unknown (4 bytes, must not be 0)"]
    img_sz["Image size (4 bytes)"]
    magic["bfw-HGW\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0 (20 byte string)"]
    data["Data block (Block size)"]
  end
```

An ordered bit-map of the blocks received is updated from the sequence number along with the image size as the packets
can be sent and received non-sequentially.

Once all the blocks have been received the upgrade will commence from the final image stored at the hardcoded offset
`0x82000000` ([U-Boot] environment variable `loadaddr`) with the following command sequence:

``` sh
nand erase.part system_sw; run ubi_init; run switchbankA && upgrade 0x82000000 0x<size>
run switchbankB && upgrade 0x82000000 0x<size>
ubi remove rootfs_data && ubi create rootfs_data 0x2000000
```

## Image format

!!! note "The 8311 community firmware archives include the multicast images, skip past to the [Upgrade Script](#upgrade-script) to get started!"

The multicast image is a concatenated binary blob of the following uImage files: `kernel.bin`, `bootcore.bin`, and
`rootfs.img`.

### Install packages <small>Debian Linux</small> { #install-packages data-toc-label="Install packages" }

``` sh
sudo apt-get -y install u-boot-tools squashfs-tools 7zip
```

### Blobs

The following blobs can be obtained from the 8311 community firmware archive or personal backups after following the
[dump & backup firmware](install-the-8311-community-firmware-on-the-was-110.md#dump-and-backup-firmware)
guide.

__kernel.bin__

:       dumpimage -T kernel kernel.bin -o zImage
        7z e -so zImage > vmlinux
        mkimage -A MIPS -O Linux -T kernel -a 0xa0020000 -C lzma -e 0xa0020000 -n "PON_1.18.1" -d zImage kernel.bin

__bootcore.bin__

:       dumpimage -T kernel bootcore.bin -o u-boot.bin
        mkimage -A MIPS -O Linux -T kernel -a 0x88000000 -C none -e 0x88000000 -n "MIPS 4Kec Bootcore" -d u-boot.bin bootcore.bin

__rootfs.img__

:       unsquashfs -d rootfs rootfs.img
        mksquashfs
        mkimage -A MIPS -O Linux -T filesystem -C none -n "<version>" -d rootfs.squashfs rootfs.bin

``` sh
cat kernel.bin bootcore.bin rootfs.bin > multicast.img
```

## Upgrade Script

Python installation varies by Operating System and has been outlined by the tutors at
[Real Python &mdash; Python 3 Installation & Setup Guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python).

<script src="https://gist.github.com/djGrrr/802c5652d3610d3e0a63243fe1119c56.js"></script>

### Host setup

#### Download

=== ":simple-linux: Linux / :simple-freebsd: FreeBSD / :simple-apple: macOS"

    ``` sh
    curl https://gist.github.com/djGrrr/802c5652d3610d3e0a63243fe1119c56/raw/3d9feef42107232e0ef7f2a4c469a00e915a16d3/multicast_upgrader.py
    chmod +x multicast_upgrader.py
    ```

=== ":material-microsoft: Windows"

    ```sh
    curl.exe https://gist.github.com/djGrrr/802c5652d3610d3e0a63243fe1119c56/raw/3d9feef42107232e0ef7f2a4c469a00e915a16d3/multicast_upgrader.py
    ```

The [upgrade script](#upgrade-script) works with the `multicast_update.img` and `multicast_reset.img` files from the
8311 community firmware archive, which you can download at:

<https://github.com/djGrrr/8311-was-110-firmware-builder/releases/latest>

#### Requirements

__10G SFP+ port__

:    A 10-gigabit compatible SFP+ host interface, such as a NIC, media converter, and/or network switch with its port
     settings __forced__ to 10Gbps. If using a switch, it's important to disable STP on the port(s).

    ??? info
        The ethernet side of the [WAS-110] is forced to __10GBASE-KR__[^1] in [U-Boot] as can be observed from the
        environment variable `lan1-xpcs-mode`; It won't fallback to 1G.

        === "OpenWrt"

            ``` sh
            fw_printenv lan1-xpcs-mode
            ```

        === "U-Boot"

            ``` sh
            env print lan1-xpcs-mode
            ```

        If you are flashing with a 2.5G port (like a switch or a SFP Media Buddy) you must force the SFP+ side to use
        __2P5G_SGMII_MODE__.

        === "OpenWrt"

            ``` sh
            fwenv_set lan1-xpcs-mode 2P5G_SGMII_MODE
            ```

        === "U-Boot"

            ``` sh
            env set lan1-xpcs-mode 2P5G_SGMII_MODE
            env save
            env save
            ```


__Static IP address `192.168.1.2/24`__

:   === ":simple-linux: Linux / :simple-freebsd: FreeBSD / :simple-apple: macOS"

        ```sh
        ip address add 192.168.1.2/24 dev <interface>
        ```

    === ":material-microsoft: Windows"

        ```sh
        netsh interface ipv4 set address name="<interface name>" static 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1
        ```

    ??? info
        The default [WAS-110]  [U-Boot] IP address is `192.168.1.1` and can be retrieved from the environment variable
        `ipaddr`.

        === "OpenWrt"

            ``` sh
            fw_printenv ipaddr

            ```

        === "U-Boot"

            ``` sh
            env print ipaddr
            ```

__Static ARP entry__

:   __Unicast__ (1 to 1)

    === ":simple-linux: Linux / :simple-freebsd: FreeBSD / :simple-apple: macOS"

        ```sh
        arp -s 192.168.1.1 00:E0:92:00:01:40
        ```

    === ":material-microsoft: Windows"

        ```sh
        netsh interface ipv4 add neighbors "<interface name>" 192.168.1.1 "00-E0-92-00-01-40"
        ```

    __Multicast__

    === ":simple-linux: Linux / :simple-freebsd: FreeBSD / :simple-apple: macOS"

        ```sh
        arp -s 192.168.1.1 01:E0:92:00:01:40
        ```

    === ":material-microsoft: Windows"

        ```sh
        netsh interface ipv4 add neighbors "<interface name>" 192.168.1.1 "01-E0-92-00-01-40"
        ```

    ??? info
        The default [WAS-110]  [U-Boot] MAC address is `00:E0:92:00:01:40` and can be retrieved from the environment
        variable `ethaddr`.

        === "OpenWrt"

            ``` sh
            fw_printenv ethaddr
            ```

        === "U-Boot"

            ``` sh
            env print ethaddr
            ```

### Usage

!!! warning "Without serial access, you'll be running blind. Proceed with caution and take more time between the steps"

#### Upgrade

1. Remove the [WAS-110]

2. Run the `multicast_upgrader.py` [script]

    === ":simple-linux: Linux / :simple-freebsd: FreeBSD / :simple-apple: macOS"

        ```
        ./multicast_upgrader.py --path=multicast_upgrade.img
        ```

    === ":material-microsoft: Windows"

        ```
        python3.exe multicast_upgrader.py --path=multicast_upgrade.img
        ```

3. Insert the [WAS-110]

4. Wait several minutes (3-5)

5. Press ++ctrl+x++ to end the `multicast_upgrader.py` [script]

6. Reseat the [WAS-110]

    ??? tip "Run a continuous ping"
        To recieve an early indication that the [WAS-110] has completed its first boot, run a continuous ping:

        ``` sh
        ping 192.168.11.1
        ```

#### Reset

!!! note "Previous settings will be backed up and stored in `/ptconf`."
    It is advisable to reflash with a regular image afterward, as your settings may be unintentionally restored to
    their defaults if the backup file is not present or has been removed.

1. Remove the [WAS-110]

2. Run the `multicast_upgrader.py` [script]

    === ":simple-linux: Linux / :simple-freebsd: FreeBSD / :simple-apple: macOS"
