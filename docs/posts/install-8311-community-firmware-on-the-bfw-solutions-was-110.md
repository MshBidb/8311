??? tip "Group buy participants..."
    Just a reminder that your [WAS-110] should have come pre-flashed with the 8311 community firmware unless otherwise
    indicated.

    Please ignore the Azores [shell upgrade] and [web UI upgrade](#web-ui-upgrade) sections mentioned below. To update
    your [WAS-110] to a *newer* 8311 community firmware release, refer to the instructions in the
    [supplementary upgrade] section.

Out of the box, the [WAS-110] is not fully compatible with varying ISP OLT configurations, with issues ranging from
vendor-specific managed entities to VEIP to IEEE standards such as [802.1X] and [802.1ad]. Due to these
incompatibilities and discovered bugs, a community firmware[^1] has been curated to fix any impeding issues[^2].

  [802.1X]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1X
  [802.1ad]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1ad

## Firmware Preparation

### Download firmware

The community firmware comes in two (2) variants: *basic* and *bfw*; for the purposes of this guide, we'll focus on
the recommended <ins>basic</ins> firmware, which can be downloaded at:

<https://github.com/djGrrr/8311-was-110-firmware-builder/releases/latest>

As an example, the following command downloads the *basic* firmware into the current users download directory.

=== ":material-microsoft: Windows"

    ``` sh
    curl.exe -L --output-dir %UserProfile%\Downloads -O https://github.com/djGrrr/8311-was-110-firmware-builder/releases/download/v2.7.2/WAS-110_8311_firmware_mod_v2.7.2_basic.exe
    ```

=== ":simple-apple: macOS / :simple-linux: Linux"

    ``` sh
    curl -L --output-dir ~/Downloads -O https://github.com/djGrrr/8311-was-110-firmware-builder/releases/download/v2.7.2/WAS-110_8311_firmware_mod_v2.7.2_basic.7z
    ```

The *basic* firmware is based on a vanilla MaxLinear [OpenWrt] 19.07 build from [Potrontec]. Additionally, it
includes customized luci web interfaces for hassle-free masquerading and the aforementioned fixes. And unlike the *bfw*
variant, it does not include the abysmal BFW patches and cruft.

  [OpenWrt]: https://openwrt.org/
  [Potrontec]: https://www.potrontec.com/

### Extract download

The community firmware upgrade comes bundled as a self-extracting executable (:material-microsoft: Windows only) or a
[7-Zip] archive and includes:

`local-upgrade.img`

:   Used with the Azores [web upgrade] utility.

`local-upgrade.tar`

:   Used with the universal [shell upgrade] command sequence.

  [web upgrade]: #web-ui-upgrade
  [shell upgrade]: #shell-upgrade
  [7-Zip]: https://www.7-zip.org/

To extract the archive to a temporary directory, execute the following command(s):

!!! info "Replace `<version>` with the downloaded version."

=== ":material-microsoft: Windows"

    #### Self-extracting Executable

    Double-click on the exe file in [Windows File Explorer].

    #### 7-zip

    ``` sh
    7z e "-i!local-upgrade.*" %UserProfile%\Downloads\WAS-110_8311_firmware_mod_<version>_basic.7z -o%Temp%\8311
    ```

      [Windows File Explorer]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Explorer

=== ":simple-apple: macOS"

    !!! bug "macOS Archive Utility mangles the extracted `local-upgrade.tar`"

    !!! note "The following commands assume [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is installed"

    ``` sh
    brew install sevenzip
    7zz e '-i!local-upgrade.*' ~/Downloads/WAS-110_8311_firmware_mod_<version>_basic.7z -o/tmp
    ```

=== ":simple-linux: Linux"

    !!! note "The following commands assume [Debian] or derivatives[^3]"

    ``` sh
    sudo apt-get install p7zip-full
    7z e '-i!local-upgrade.*' ~/Downloads/WAS-110_8311_firmware_mod_<version>_basic.7z -o/tmp #(1)!
    ```

## Network setup

Plug the [WAS-110] into a 10-gigabit compatible SFP+ host interface, such as a NIC, media converter, and/or network
switch.

!!! note "Rx loss"
    The [WAS-110] running the default Azores firmware will trigger RX_LOS if the SC/APC fiber cable is unplugged or
    inactive. Some host interfaces will enter a power-saving state, making the [WAS-110] inaccessible.

The default IP address of the [WAS-110] is `192.168.11.1/24`. To connect successfully, choose one (1) of the following
configurations based on your network setup:

* [Static IP](#static-ip)
* [Static Route](#static-route)
* [Source NAT](#source-nat)

=== "Static IP"

    === ":material-microsoft: Windows"

        !!! info "For the shameless mouse clickers..."
            If you are more comfortable with the Windows GUI, follow the <ins>manual</ins> steps outlined by Microsoft at:

            <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-tcp-ip-settings-bd0a07af-15f5-cd6a-363f-ca2b6f391ace>

## Supplementary upgrades

### A/B architecture

    classDef boldTitle fill:transparent,stroke:transparent,font-weight:bold;
    class BOOT,PERSIST transparentBlock
    class A,B boldTitle
```

The [WAS-110] uses an A/B architecture, which means there are two adjacent firmware images: an active image
(the currently running and firmware) and an inactive image. Either image can be selected as active, and upon upgrade,
the inactive image will be overwritten and become the newly active image after reboot, i.e. committed image.

Furthermore, the OLT has the capability to select the active firmware image, upgrade the inactive image, and reboot
the ONT. It is therefore recommended to install the community firmware on both A and B slots.

### Web UI upgrade <small>safe</small> { #8311-web-ui-upgrade data-toc-label="Web UI upgrade" }

!!! info "Integrity first and foremost"
    The 8311 community firmware re-uses the <ins>safe</ins> shell upgrade logic throughout. Those who prefer the CLI
    may continue to use the [shell upgrade] method going forward.

    Furthermore, the 8311 community firmware includes an up-to-date `dropbear`[^4] build, which does not require the use
    of weak algorithms when using an SSH client, i.e.

    `-oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -oPubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa`

    can be removed from future command usage.
